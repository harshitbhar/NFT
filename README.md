# NFT

### Description:
This project involves generating a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney, storing the items on IPFS using pinata.cloud, deploying an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet, mapping the NFT collection using the Polygon network token mapper, writing hardhat scripts to batch mint and transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge, approving the NFTs for transfer, depositing the NFTs to the Bridge, and finally testing `balanceOf` on Mumbai. 

### Project Components:

1. **NFT Collection Generation:**
   - Generate a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney.

2. **IPFS Storage:**
   - Store the generated items on IPFS using pinata.cloud or any other suitable IPFS service.

3. **Contract Deployment:**
   - Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.

4. **Prompt Description Functionality:**
   - Implement a `promptDescription` function on the contract that returns the prompt used to generate the images.

5. **Mapping on Polygon Network:**
   - Map the NFT collection using the Polygon network token mapper for visualization.

6. **Hardhat Script for Batch Minting:**
   - Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs. Utilize ERC721A for optimal performance.

7. **Hardhat Script for Batch Transfer:**
   - Develop a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.

8. **Approval and Deposit:**
   - Ensure that the NFTs are approved for transfer and deposit them to the Bridge.

9. **Testing on Mumbai:**
   - Test the `balanceOf` function on the Mumbai network to verify successful transfer.

10. **Readme File:**
    - Provide detailed instructions and documentation for the project.

### Execution Steps:

1. **NFT Collection Generation and IPFS Storage:**
   - Generate the collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney.
   - Store the items on IPFS using pinata.cloud.

2. **Contract Deployment:**
   - Deploy the ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet using Hardhat or a similar tool.

3. **Prompt Description Functionality:**
   - Implement the `promptDescription` function on the deployed contract.

4. **Mapping on Polygon Network:**
   - Map the NFT collection using the Polygon network token mapper for visualization.

5. **Hardhat Script for Batch Minting:**
   - Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs efficiently, utilizing ERC721A if possible.

6. **Hardhat Script for Batch Transfer:**
   - Develop a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.

7. **Approval and Deposit:**
   - Approve the NFTs for transfer and deposit them to the Bridge for cross-chain transfer.

8. **Testing on Mumbai:**
   - Test the `balanceOf` function on the Mumbai network to ensure successful transfer and availability of NFTs.
